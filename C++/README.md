## C++ Projects

### Monte Carlo Engine to Estimate value of PI

Built a basic monte carlo engine to simualate to 'n' instances to get value of pi.

**Formula:**

π ≈ 4 × (N_inside / N_total)

Where:
- `N_inside` is the number of random points that fall inside the quarter circle
- `N_total` is the total number of random points generated

### Handcricket

Built a basic handcricket game.

Usual rules, should add difficulties and extra features.
