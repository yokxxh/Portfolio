## C++ Projects

### Monte Carlo Engine to Estimate value of PI

Built a basic monte carlo engine to simualate to 'n' instances to get value of pi.

**Formula:**

π ≈ 4 × (N_inside / N_total)

Where:
- `N_inside` is the number of random points that fall inside the quarter circle
- `N_total` is the total number of random points generated

### Present & Future Value Calculator

 Future Value: 𝐹𝑉=𝐶×(1+𝑟)𝑡
 Present Value: 𝑃𝑉=𝐶(1+𝑟)𝑡
 
 Where:
 - `C` is the Capital
 - `r` is the interest rate
 - `​t` is the time period

### Handcricket

Built a basic handcricket game.

Usual rules, should add difficulties and extra features.
