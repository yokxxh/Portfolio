# Portfolio üìÇ

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of programs, projects, and notebooks I've worked on, primarily for practice and presentations. You‚Äôll find my work across various domains, including C++ programming, Data Science, and Machine Learning. Feel free to explore!


## üñ•Ô∏è C++ Projects

[**C++ Programs**](https://github.com/yokxxh/Portfolio/tree/main/C%2B%2B)

A collection of C++ programs covering a wide range of topics such as algorithms, simple calculators, and problem-solving techniques. These projects serve as practice and help reinforce concepts in the C++ language.

### Featured Topics:

* Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
* Data Structures (Linked lists, Trees, etc.)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)



## üìö Notebooks

[**Python Notebooks**](https://github.com/yokxxh/Portfolio/tree/main/Notebooks/Python)

Here you‚Äôll find Jupyter notebooks focusing on Data Science and Machine Learning. These projects are designed to showcase my skills in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning model development.

### Key Areas:

* Data Exploration & Cleaning
* Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Machine Learning (Supervised & Unsupervised)
* Deep Learning (Introductory models)


## üîç About Me

I am passionate about coding and problem-solving. These projects represent my journey as I dive deeper into different programming languages and fields, from algorithmic challenges to applying data science concepts.
